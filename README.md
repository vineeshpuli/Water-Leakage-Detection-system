# Water-Leakage-Detection-system

This is a small prototype where a small part of a single pipe which is a part of a huge piping system of a building is considered.
Using two flow sensors at each end of the pipe ,detection of leakage in the pipe is taking place.
In case of a leakage information of that leakage and information about at which part of pipe system  leakage is taking place is sent to the authorities via a mobile application.
Thingspeak is used for storing the values and retrieving for mobile app.
